/**
 * Migration-first resolution-mode change (pure, no I/O).
 *
 * When a crafting system's `resolutionMode` changes, recipes are MIGRATED to fit
 * the new mode wherever possible instead of being deleted. A recipe is only
 * deleted when a per-recipe STRUCTURAL constraint of the target mode cannot be met
 * by seeding a provider or clearing the routed `resultSelection`:
 *
 *   - narrowing to `simple` or `progressive` (which require exactly one ingredient
 *     set AND one result group) from a recipe that carries more than one of either
 *     ("1×1" = exactly one of each), or
 *   - moving a multi-step recipe into `alchemy` (alchemy does not support
 *     multi-step recipes).
 *
 * SYSTEM-LEVEL gaps (e.g. switching to `progressive` without a progressive check,
 * or to `routed`/`check` without a routed roll formula) NEVER delete or disable a
 * recipe here — they are surfaced as `blocks:'system'` validation issues by the
 * system-validation aggregator (`src/systems/systemValidation.js`) and gate
 * visibility, not deletion.
 *
 * Migratability matrix (per the `004-resolution-modes` normative 5×5). RI =
 * `routedByIngredients`, RC = `routedByCheck`:
 *
 *   | From \ To  | simple              | RI                       | RC                       | progressive         | alchemy                              |
 *   |------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
 *   | simple     | —                   | clear                    | clear; reconcile         | clear               | seed                                 |
 *   | RI         | clear if 1×1 else del| —                        | carry; reconcile         | clear if 1×1 else del| seed=ingredientSet, single-step else del |
 *   | RC         | clear if 1×1 else del| carry; reconcile         | —                        | clear if 1×1 else del| seed=check, single-step else del     |
 *   | progressive| clear               | clear                    | clear; reconcile         | —                   | seed                                 |
 *   | alchemy    | clear if 1×1 else del| clear (drop), carry      | clear (drop), carry; recon| clear if 1×1 else del| —                                   |
 *
 *   - "seed": ALCHEMY is the only provider-routed target, so seed its
 *     `resultSelection.provider` — `ingredientSet`/`check` when the source is the
 *     matching routed mode, otherwise {@link chooseSeedProvider}'s choice.
 *   - "clear": the target mode does not route via a recipe-level provider, so
 *     `resultSelection` is set to `null` (a no-op for routed modes, which never
 *     carry one).
 *   - "carry": the recipe is already structurally shaped for the target mode; it is
 *     carried verbatim.
 *   - "reconcile": the recipe survives (`carry`/`clear`) but its routing data is
 *     stale for the new basis (group names under check routing, or ingredient-set
 *     `resultGroupId` mappings under ingredient routing). It is FLAGGED via
 *     `reconcile: true` and surfaces as a re-authoring validation issue — never
 *     silently mis-routed. Re-running a `carry` with no reconcile pending is
 *     idempotent.
 *   - "delete": a structural constraint cannot be met (narrowing a >1×1 recipe into
 *     `simple`/`progressive`, or moving a multi-step recipe into `alchemy`).
 *
 * `RI↔RC` never deletes (`carry`); it reconciles stale routing. Reuses the
 * `_seedProvider`/`_clone` idiom from `migrateLegacyResolutionModes.js`. The
 * alchemy provider set is `['ingredientSet', 'check']`.
